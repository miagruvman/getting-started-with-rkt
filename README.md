# Getting started with rkt on Linux

This guide will show you how to install, build and run a "Hello World" application.

### Install rkt

To install rkt we need to download the rkt binary, that can be found on Github.

```
wget https://github.com/coreos/rkt/releases/download/v1.1.0/rkt-v1.1.0.tar.gz
```
```
tar xzvf rkt-v1.1.0.tar.gz
```
```
cd rkt-v1.1.0
```
```
./rkt help
```

### Install acbuild

To install acbuild we will clone the source repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/appc/acbuild
```
```
cd acbuild
```
```
./build
```

To make sure that your shell can find the bin/ directory executable, we will append this directory to your enviromentÂ´s $PATH variable.

```
vim ~/.bashrc
```
... and put the following lines at the end of the file:
```
export ACBUILD_BIN_DIR=~/acbuild/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ACBUILD_BIN_DIR
```
